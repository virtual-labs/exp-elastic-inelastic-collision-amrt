  <li>
    Two balls of mass 5 kg each are moving in opposite directions with equal speed, say 10 m/s, and collide head-on with each other. Predict the outcome of the collision assuming it to be:
    <ul>
      <li>Perfectly elastic</li>
      <li>Perfectly inelastic</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    A girl with mass 70.0 kg is running at 3 m/s east when she jumps onto a stationary skateboard of mass 2 kg. What is the velocity of the girl and skateboard assuming they move off together?
  </li>

  <li>
    A toy truck with mass 20 kg travels along a level tabletop at 0.50 m/s. A miniature car, with mass 5.00 g, speeds headlong towards the toy truck at 0.75 m/s. Immediately after the collision, the toy truck continues in its original direction at 0.10 m/s. What is the velocity of the miniature car?
