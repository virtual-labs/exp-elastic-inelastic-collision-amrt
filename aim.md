### Aim of the experiment
- The Elastic and Inelastic collision simulation will help to analyse the collision variations for different situations.
- Demonstration of collision behaviour for elastic and inelastic type.
- Variation of collision behavior in elastic and inelastic type.
- Study of variation of Momentum, Kinetic energy, Velocity of collision of the objects and the Center of Mass with different velocity and mass.
- Calculation of the Momentum, Kinetic energy, and Velocity after collision.
