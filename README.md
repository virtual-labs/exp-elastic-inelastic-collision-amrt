### About the Experiment 

The Elastic and Inelastic Collision experiment demonstrates how the total momentum is conserved during collisions between two bodies, while kinetic energy is conserved only in elastic collisions. By analyzing the motion before and after impact, students can distinguish between elastic and inelastic interactions.
